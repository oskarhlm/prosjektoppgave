\begin{comment}
Here you will present the architecture or model that you have chosen and which is (or will be) implemented in your work.
Note that putting algorithms in your report is not always desirable, so in certain cases those might be placed in the appendix.
Code is normally to be avoided in the report itself, but may be included in an appendix or submitted as additional documents.
(The actual code must also be submitted together with the final Master's thesis, but as a zip-file.)

Any off-the-shelf tools and methods that you use in your architecture should have been introduced earlier,
tentatively in the Background chapter (or in the Related Work chapter),
so that they can be referenced here by giving backward pointers to the previous text.

Here, or in a separate chapter (or possibly in the Background chapter or in the Experimental Setup),
you should also discuss the data that you use in your experiments (see Chapter~\ref{cha:data}).

Clearly, a figure showing the architecture is a must, such as Figure~\ref{fig:Architecture}.
Describe all parts of such a figure in reasonable detail in the text, possibly with forward pointers to sections where they will be elaborated on (or backward pointers to sections where tools and methods already have been introduced).
Mention work that motivated your architectural choices, parameter settings, etc.
Those choices should then also be discussed and elaborated on in the Discussion chapter.
