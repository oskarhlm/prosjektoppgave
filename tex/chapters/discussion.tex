\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

When evaluating your results, avoid drawing grand conclusions, beyond those that your results can in fact support. 
Further, although you may have designed your experiments to answer certain questions, 
the results may raise other questions in the eyes of the reader. 
It is important that you study the graphs/tables to look for unusual features/entries, and discuss these as well as the main findings.
In particular, carry out an error analysis: What went wrong and why? 

A confusion matrix can, for example, be a good way to display misclassifications.
Figure~\ref{fig:conf_sentiment} (on Page~\pageref{fig:conf_sentiment}) shows two confusion matrices. 
If there were perfect correlation between true and predicted labels, the long diagonals (from the upper left to the lower right corner) would be completely red. 
However,  the confusion matrices indicate 
that this classifier was quite biased towards the neutral label (illustrated with \Neutrey),
as can be seen from the warm colours in the positive (\Smiley) and negative (\Sadey) true label cells of the \Neutrey predicted label column.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

In this section it is important to include a discussion of not just the merits of the work conducted, but also the limitations. 
Which choices did you make? Why? What alternatives were there?
{\color{red}\textbf{Note that a key part of the Master's Thesis grading is based on the student's ability to discuss the results in light of the work by others as well as the restrictions and potential of the work itself.}}
While the Results section will report the outcome of each specific experiments, the Discussion should put those results into perspective and look at overall lessons that can be learned from the entire series of experiments. 

You should be able to discuss your work in relation to its overall goal and your research questions (i.e., those introduced in Chapter~\ref{cha:introduction}),
but also address issues such as any ethical considerations that the work may entail,
as well as its technical challenges and limitations.

Discussion and evaluation can either be two different chapters, a joint chapter (as here), or part of the concluding chapter
--- or the discussion can be part of that chapter while the evaluation is part of the experimental chapter.

As for most parts of the thesis, it is possible to select various outlines and setups for the discussion; the important thing is that all the relevant parts appear \textit{somewhere\/} in the text.
