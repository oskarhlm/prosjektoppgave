  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, demonstrate a strong understanding of human natural language and have been explored and applied in various fields, including reasoning, creative writing, code generation, translation, and information retrieval. By adopting LLM as the reasoning core, we introduce Autonomous GIS as an AI-powered geographic information system (GIS) that leverages the LLM's general abilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and coding for addressing spatial problems with automatic spatial data collection, analysis, and visualization. We envision that autonomous GIS will need to achieve five autonomous goals: self-generating, selforganizing, self-verifying, self-executing, and self-growing. We developed a prototype system called LLMGeo using the GPT-4 API in a Python environment, demonstrating what an autonomous GIS looks like and how it delivers expected results without human intervention using three case studies. For all case studies, LLM-Geo was able to return accurate results, including aggregated numbers, graphs, and maps, significantly reducing manual operation time. Although still in its infancy and lacking several important modules such as logging and code testing, LLM-Geo demonstrates a potential path toward the nextgeneration AI-powered GIS. We advocate for the GIScience community to dedicate more effort to the research and development of autonomous GIS, making spatial analysis easier, faster, and more accessible to a broader audience.},

  abstract = {Background: Current evidence on the association between high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) levels and mortality in elderly sarcopenic patients is limited. This study aimed to investigate the association of serum hs-cTnT concentrations with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in older adults with low lean mass (LLM) and without baseline cardiovascular disease. Methods: This prospective cohort study included 369 older adults (representing 3.2 million people) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999\textendash 2004. Individuals were linked to national death records until 31 December 2019. The weighted Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cox proportional hazards models, restricted cubic spline models, stratified analysis, interaction analysis, and sensitivity analysis were performed to examine the association between hs-cTnT levels and mortality in older adults with LLM. Results: During 4697 person-years of follow-up (median duration, 14.6 years), 228 (65.6\%) deaths were documented, including 56 (15.8\%) deaths from cardiovascular disease. Individuals with a hs-cTnT level of {$\geq$}14 ng/L had 2.1- and 4.4-fold higher risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively. Compared with the lowest quartile, the fourth quartile of hs-cTnT levels was significantly associated with 3.1- and 6.4-fold higher risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively. Each one standard deviation increase in natural log-transformed hs-cTnT levels significantly and linearly increased the risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality by 39\% and 61\%, respectively. Stratified and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the association. Conclusions: In this nationally representative cohort of US older adults with LLM, higher serum hs-cTnT concentrations were significantly associated with increased risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. \textcopyright{} 2023},

  abstract = {Efficient information search from building information models (BIMs) requires deep BIM knowledge or extensive engineering efforts for building natural language (NL)-based interfaces. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a dynamic prompt-based virtual assistant framework dubbed ``BIMS-GPT'' that integrates generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) technologies, supporting NL-based BIM search. To understand users' NL queries, extract relevant information from BIM databases, and deliver NL responses along with 3D visualizations, a dynamic prompt-based process was developed. In a case study, BIMS-GPT's functionality is demonstrated through a virtual assistant prototype for a hospital building. When evaluated with a BIM query dataset, the approach achieves accuracy rates of 99.5\% for classifying NL queries with incorporating 2\% of the data in prompts. This paper contributes to the advancement of effective and versatile virtual assistants for BIMs in the construction industry as it significantly enhances BIM accessibility while reducing the engineering and training data prerequisites for processing NL queries. \textcopyright{} 2023},
