In 2016, the OGC has initiated the creation of a new generation of standards based on the OpenAPI specifications to facilitate the integration of geospatial data in modern web applications and systems. From a practical perspective this paper intends to address the question how organizations and institutions anticipate to leverage this new generation of standards in order to deploy a geospatial data infrastructure. This issue is at the core of this article and at the center of a project that seeks to address the issue by running a Testbed Platform with a special focus to the Swiss context. To challenge these standards, the Testbed platform is configured to run a showcase with experimental cases about climate change. It is expected to bring good visibility toward all actors concerned by the Swiss standardization process and to raise interest from government stakeholders, technical or not, companies and universities as a community in synergy when considering the advances at the OGC},

  abstract = {In the era of cloud computing, big data and Internet of things, research is very often data-driven: based on the analysis of data, increasingly available in large quantities and collected by experiments, observations or simulations. These data are very often characterized as being dynamic in space and time and as continuously expanding (monitoring) or change (data quality management or survey). Modern Spatial Data Infrastructures (e.g.\&\#160; swisstopo or INSPIRE), are based on interoperable Web services which expose and serve large quantities of data on the Internet using widely accepted and used open standards defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). These standards mostly comply with FAIR principles but do not offer any capability to retrieve a dataset how it was in a defined instant, to refer to its status in that specific instant and to guarantee its immutability. These three aspects hinder the replicability of research based on such a kind of services. We discuss the issue here and the state of the art\&\#160; and propose a possible solution to fill this gap, using or extending when needed the existing standards and or adopting best practices in the fields of sensor data, satellite data and vector data.},

In this paper, we bring LLMs to the realm of geoscience with the objective of advancing research and applications in this field. To this end, we present the first-ever LLM in geoscience, K2, alongside a suite of resources developed to further promote LLM research within geoscience. For instance, we have curated the first geoscience instruction tuning dataset, GeoSignal, which aims to align LLM responses to geoscience-related user queries. Additionally, we have established the first geoscience benchmark, GeoBench, to evaluate LLMs in the context of geoscience. In this work, we experiment with a complete recipe to adapt a pre-trained general-domain LLM to the geoscience domain. Specifically, we further train the LLaMA-7B model on 5.5B tokens of geoscience text corpus, including over 1 million pieces of geoscience literature, and utilize GeoSignal's supervised data to fine-tune the model. Moreover, we share a protocol that can efficiently gather domain-specific data and construct domain-supervised data, even in situations where manpower is scarce. Meanwhile, we equip K2 with the abilities of using tools to be a naive geoscience aide. Experiments conducted on the GeoBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and datasets on geoscience knowledge understanding and utilization.We open-source all the training data and K2 model checkpoints at https://github.com/davendw49/k2.},

As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

  abstract = {As a core task in location-based services (LBS) (e.g., navigation maps), query and point of interest (POI) matching connects users' intent with real-world geographic information. Recently, pre-trained models (PTMs) have made advancements in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Generic text-based PTMs do not have enough geographic knowledge for query-POI matching. To overcome this limitation, related literature attempts to employ domain-adaptive pre-training based on geo-related corpus. However, a query generally contains mentions of multiple geographic objects, such as nearby roads and regions of interest (ROIs). The geographic context (GC), i.e., these diverse geographic objects and their relationships, is therefore pivotal to retrieving the most relevant POI. Single-modal PTMs can barely make use of the important GC and therefore have limited performance. In this work, we propose a novel query-POI matching method Multi-modal Geographic language model (MGeo), which comprises a geographic encoder and a multi-modal interaction module. MGeo represents GC as a new modality and is able to fully extract multi-modal correlations for accurate query-POI matching. Besides, there is no publicly available benchmark for this topic. In order to facilitate further research, we build a new open-source large-scale benchmark Geographic TExtual Similarity (GeoTES). The POIs come from an open-source geographic information system (GIS). The queries are manually generated by annotators to prevent privacy issues. Compared with several strong baselines, the extensive experiment results and detailed ablation analyses on GeoTES demonstrate that our proposed multi-modal pre-training method can significantly improve the query-POI matching capability of generic PTMs, even when the queries' GC is not provided. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/PhantomGrapes/MGeo.},

RAG systems are composed of a retrieval and an LLM based generation module, and provide LLMs with knowledge from a reference textual database, which enables them to act as a natural language layer between a user and textual databases, reducing the risk of hallucinations. Evaluating RAG architectures is, however, challenging because there are several dimensions to consider: the ability of the retrieval system to identify relevant and focused context passages, the ability of the LLM to exploit such passages in a faithful way, or the quality of the generation itself. With RAGAs, we put forward a suite of metrics which can be used to evaluate these different dimensions {\textbackslash}textit\{without having to rely on ground truth human annotations\}. We posit that such a framework can crucially contribute to faster evaluation cycles of RAG architectures, which is especially important given the fast adoption of LLMs.},

AutoGPT experiences of users can be characterized by learning programs, autonomous applications, conducting research, and writing reports. The results of this study showed that content creation is the most important purpose of using Auto-GPT. As independent research functions of Auto-GPT, users also emphasize data summarization and information organization. However, the participants also pointed out the token limit (inefficiency), forgetting generated tools, and iteration as some prominent limitations of Auto-GPT.

  abstract = {Text-to-SQL aims at generating SQL queries for the given natural language questions and thus helping users to query databases. Prompt learning with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a recent approach, which designs prompts to lead LLMs to understand the input question and generate the corresponding SQL. However, it faces challenges with strict SQL syntax requirements. Existing work prompts the LLMs with a list of demonstration examples (i.e. question-SQL pairs) to generate SQL, but the fixed prompts can hardly handle the scenario where the semantic gap between the retrieved demonstration and the input question is large. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented prompting method for a LLM-based Text-to-SQL framework, involving sample-aware prompting and a dynamic revision chain. Our approach incorporates sample-aware demonstrations, which include the composition of SQL operators and fine-grained information related to the given question. To retrieve questions sharing similar intents with input questions, we propose two strategies for assisting retrieval. Firstly, we leverage LLMs to simplify the original questions, unifying the syntax and thereby clarifying the users' intentions. To generate executable and accurate SQLs without human intervention, we design a dynamic revision chain which iteratively adapts fine-grained feedback from the previously generated SQL. Experimental results on three Text-to-SQL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over strong baseline models.},

Despite initial gains that were obtained by applying generic PTMs to geo-related tasks at Baidu Maps, a clear performance plateau over time was observed. One of the main reasons for this plateau is the lack of readily available geographic knowledge in generic PTMs. To address this problem, in this paper, we present ERNIE-GeoL, which is a geography-and-language pre-trained model designed and developed for improving the geo-related tasks at Baidu Maps. ERNIE-GeoL is elaborately designed to learn a universal representation of geography-language by pre-training on large-scale data generated from a heterogeneous graph that contains abundant geographic knowledge. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of ERNIE-GeoL. ERNIE-GeoL has already been deployed in production at Baidu Maps since April 2021, which significantly benefits the performance of various downstream tasks. This demonstrates that ERNIE-GeoL can serve as a fundamental backbone for a wide range of geo-related tasks.},

  abstract = {We present the hierarchical graph infomax (HGI) approach for learning urban region representations (vector embeddings) with points-of-interest (POIs) in a fully unsupervised manner, which can be used in various downstream tasks. Specifically, HGI comprises several key steps: (1) training category embeddings as the initial features of POIs; (2) interconnecting POIs with a graph structure and performing graph convolution to capture the uniqueness of each POI based on its spatial context; (3) aggregating POIs to the regional level using multi-head attention mechanisms, to consider the multi-faceted influence from POIs to regions; (4) performing graph convolution at the regional level to generate region representations, to incorporate the similarities between adjacent regions; (5) aggregating region representations to produce an embedding at the city level. The model is finally trained through maximizing the mutual information among the POI {\textendash} region {\textendash} city hierarchy, which facilitates the information from local (POIs) and global (city) scales flowing to the learned region representations, making them both locally and globally relevant. We perform extensive experiments on three downstream tasks, i.e., estimating urban functional distributions, population density, and housing price, in the study areas of Xiamen Island and Shenzhen, China. The results indicate that HGI considerably outperforms several competitive baselines in all three tasks, which proves that HGI could produce meaningful and effective region representations. In addition, the learned region representations based on POIs can potentially be used for reinforcing data representations from other modalities, e.g., remote sensing data. The implementation of HGI can be found at https://github.com/RightBank/HGI.},

  abstract = {An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.},

  abstract = {Despite the remarkable ability of large language models (LMs) to comprehend and generate language, they have a tendency to hallucinate and create factually inaccurate output. Augmenting LMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing retrieval augmented LMs employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets. FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/jzbjyb/FLARE.},

  abstract = {Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

However, three pivotal questions remain unanswered: (1) How effective are current LLMs in utilizing tools? (2) How can we enhance LLMs' ability to utilize tools? (3) What obstacles need to be overcome to leverage tools? To address these questions, we introduce API-Bank, a groundbreaking benchmark, specifically designed for tool-augmented LLMs. For the first question, we develop a runnable evaluation system consisting of 73 API tools. We annotate 314 tool-use dialogues with 753 API calls to assess the existing LLMs' capabilities in planning, retrieving, and calling APIs. For the second question, we construct a comprehensive training set containing 1,888 tool-use dialogues from 2,138 APIs spanning 1,000 distinct domains. Using this dataset, we train Lynx, a tool-augmented LLM initialized from Alpaca. Experimental results demonstrate that GPT-3.5 exhibits improved tool utilization compared to GPT-3, while GPT-4 excels in planning. However, there is still significant potential for further improvement. Moreover, Lynx surpasses Alpaca's tool utilization performance by more than 26 pts and approaches the effectiveness of GPT-3.5. Through error analysis, we highlight the key challenges for future research in this field to answer the third question.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, demonstrate a strong understanding of human natural language and have been explored and applied in various fields, including reasoning, creative writing, code generation, translation, and information retrieval. By adopting LLM as the reasoning core, we introduce Autonomous GIS as an AI-powered geographic information system (GIS) that leverages the LLM's general abilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and coding for addressing spatial problems with automatic spatial data collection, analysis, and visualization. We envision that autonomous GIS will need to achieve five autonomous goals: self-generating, self-organizing, self-verifying, self-executing, and self-growing. We developed a prototype system called LLM-Geo using the GPT-4 API in a Python environment, demonstrating what an autonomous GIS looks like and how it delivers expected results without human intervention using three case studies. For all case studies, LLM-Geo was able to return accurate results, including aggregated numbers, graphs, and maps, significantly reducing manual operation time. Although still in its infancy and lacking several important modules such as logging and code testing, LLM-Geo demonstrates a potential path toward the next-generation AI-powered GIS. We advocate for the GIScience community to dedicate more effort to the research and development of autonomous GIS, making spatial analysis easier, faster, and more accessible to a broader audience.},

  abstract = {Text augmentation is a technique for constructing synthetic data from an under-resourced corpus to improve predictive performance. Synthetic data generation is common in numerous domains. However, recently text augmentation has emerged in natural language processing (NLP) to improve downstream tasks. One of the current state-of-the-art text augmentation techniques is easy data augmentation (EDA), which augments the training data by injecting and replacing synonyms and randomly permuting sentences. One major obstacle with EDA is the need for versatile and complete synonym dictionaries, which cannot be easily found in low-resource languages. To improve the utility of EDA, we propose two extensions, easy distributional data augmentation (EDDA) and type specific similar word replacement (TSSR), which uses semantic word context information and part-of-speech tags for word replacement and augmentation. In an extensive empirical evaluation, we show the utility of the proposed methods, measured by F1 score, on two representative datasets in Swedish as an example of a low-resource language. With the proposed methods, we show that augmented data improve classification performances in low-resource settings.},

  abstract = {This survey reviews works in which language models (LMs) are augmented with reasoning skills and the ability to use tools. The former is defined as decomposing a potentially complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists in calling external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs can leverage these augmentations separately or in combination via heuristics, or learn to do so from demonstrations. While adhering to a standard missing tokens prediction objective, such augmented LMs can use various, possibly non-parametric external modules to expand their context processing ability, thus departing from the pure language modeling paradigm. We therefore refer to them as Augmented Language Models (ALMs). The missing token objective allows ALMs to learn to reason, use tools, and even act, while still performing standard natural language tasks and even outperforming most regular LMs on several benchmarks. In this work, after reviewing current advance in ALMs, we conclude that this new research direction has the potential to address common limitations of traditional LMs such as interpretability, consistency, and scalability issues.},

  abstract = {Recently, it has been observed that a transfer learning solution might be all we need to solve many few-shot learning benchmarks -- thus raising important questions about when and how meta-learning algorithms should be deployed. In this paper, we seek to clarify these questions by 1. proposing a novel metric -- the diversity coefficient -- to measure the diversity of tasks in a few-shot learning benchmark and 2. by comparing Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and transfer learning under fair conditions (same architecture, same optimizer, and all models trained to convergence). Using the diversity coefficient, we show that the popular MiniImageNet and CIFAR-FS few-shot learning benchmarks have low diversity. This novel insight contextualizes claims that transfer learning solutions are better than meta-learned solutions in the regime of low diversity under a fair comparison. Specifically, we empirically find that a low diversity coefficient correlates with a high similarity between transfer learning and MAML learned solutions in terms of accuracy at meta-test time and classification layer similarity (using feature based distance metrics like SVCCA, PWCCA, CKA, and OPD). To further support our claim, we find this meta-test accuracy holds even as the model size changes. Therefore, we conclude that in the low diversity regime, MAML and transfer learning have equivalent meta-test performance when both are compared fairly. We also hope our work inspires more thoughtful constructions and quantitative evaluations of meta-learning benchmarks in the future.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the performance of ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), in a geographic information systems (GIS) exam. As LLMs like ChatGPT become increasingly prevalent in various domains, including education, it is important to understand their capabilities and limitations in specialized subject areas such as GIS. Human learning of spatial concepts significantly differs from LLM training methodologies. Therefore, this study aims to assess ChatGPT's performance and ability to grasp geospatial concepts by challenging it with a real GIS exam. By analyzing ChatGPT's responses and evaluating its understanding of GIS principles, we gain insights into the potential applications and challenges of LLMs in spatially-oriented fields. We conduct our evaluation with two models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to understand whether general improvements of an LLM translate to improvements in answering questions related to the spatial domain. We find that both GPT variants can pass a balanced, introductory GIS exam, scoring 63.3\% (GPT-3.5) and 88.3\% (GPT-4), which correspond to grades D and B+ respectively in standard US letter grading scale. In addition, we also identify specific questions and topics where the LLMs struggle to grasp spatial concepts, highlighting the challenges in teaching such topics to these models. Finally, we assess ChatGPT's performance in specific aspects of GIS, including spatial analysis, basic concepts of mapping, and data management. This granular analysis provides further insights into the strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT's GIS literacy. This research contributes to the ongoing dialogue on the integration of AI models in education and can provide guidance for educators, researchers, and practitioners seeking to leverage LLMs in GIS. By focusing on specific questions or concepts that pose difficulties for the LLM, this study addresses the nuances of teaching spatial concepts to AI models and offers potential avenues for improvement in spatial literacy within future iterations of LLMs.},

  abstract = {In recent years, web crawling has gained a significant attention due to the drastic advancements in the World Wide Web. Web Search Engines have the issue of retrieving massive quantity of web documents. One among the web crawlers is the focused crawler, that intends to selectively gather web pages from the Internet. But the efficiency of the focused crawling can easily be affected by the environment of web pages. In this view, this paper presents an Automated Word Embedding with Parameter Tuned Deep Learning (AWE-PTDL) model for focused web crawling. The proposed model involves different processes namely pre-processing, Incremental Skip-gram Model with Negative Sampling (ISGNS) based word embedding, bidirectional long short-term memory-based classification and bird swarm optimization based hyperparameter tuning. The SGNS training desires to go over the complete training data to pre-compute the noise distribution before performing Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and the ISGNS technique is derived for the word embedding process. Besides, the cosine similarity is computed from the word embedding matrix to generate a feature vector which is fed as input into the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) for the prediction of website relevance. Finally, the Birds Swarm Optimization-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BSO-BiLSTM) based classification model is used to classify the webpages and the BSO algorithm is employed to determine the hyperparameters of the BiLSTM model so that the overall crawling performance can be considerably enhanced. For validating the enhanced outcome of the presented model, a comprehensive set of simulations are carried out and the results are examined in terms of different measures. The Automated Word Embedding with Parameter Tuned Deep Learning (AWE-PTDL) technique has attained a higher harvest rate of 85\% when compared with the other techniques. The experimental results highlight the enhanced web crawling performance of the proposed model over the recent state of art web crawlers.},

While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10\% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs), associated with deep learning-based computer vision techniques, have shown substantial potential for automating a variety of tasks. These are known as Visual LLMs and one notable model is Visual ChatGPT, which combines ChatGPT's LLM capabilities with visual computation to enable effective image analysis. These models' abilities to process images based on textual inputs can revolutionize diverse fields, and while their application in the remote sensing domain remains unexplored, it is important to acknowledge that novel implementations are to be expected. Thus, this is the first paper to examine the potential of Visual ChatGPT, a cutting-edge LLM founded on the GPT architecture, to tackle the aspects of image processing related to the remote sensing domain. Among its current capabilities, Visual ChatGPT can generate textual descriptions of images, perform canny edge and straight line detection, and conduct image segmentation. These offer valuable insights into image content and facilitate the interpretation and extraction of information. By exploring the applicability of these techniques within publicly available datasets of satellite images, we demonstrate the current model's limitations in dealing with remote sensing images, highlighting its challenges and future prospects. Although still in early development, we believe that the combination of LLMs and visual models holds a significant potential to transform remote sensing image processing, creating accessible and practical application opportunities in the field.},

For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging, the process of classifying words into their respective parts of speech (e.g., verb or noun), is essential in various natural language processing applications. POS tagging is a crucial preprocessing task for applications like machine translation, question answering, sentiment analysis, etc. However, existing corpora for POS tagging in Persian mainly consist of formal texts, such as daily news and newspapers. As a result, smart POS tools, machine learning models, and deep learning models trained on these corpora may not perform optimally for processing colloquial text in social network analysis. Method: This paper introduces a novel corpus, "Colloquial Persian POS" (CPPOS), specifically designed to support colloquial Persian text. The corpus includes formal and informal text collected from various domains such as political, social, and commercial on Telegram, Twitter, and Instagram more than 520K labeled tokens. After collecting posts from these social platforms for one year, special preprocessing steps were conducted, including normalization, sentence tokenizing, and word tokenizing for social text. The tokens and sentences were then manually annotated and verified by a team of linguistic experts. This study also defines a POS tagging guideline for annotating the data and conducting the annotation process. Results: To evaluate the quality of CPPOS, various deep learning models, such as the RNN family, were trained using the constructed corpus. A comparison with another well-known Persian POS corpus named "Bijankhan" and the Persian Hazm POS tool trained on Bijankhan revealed that our model trained on CPPOS outperforms them. With the new corpus and the BiLSTM deep neural model, we achieved a 14\% improvement over the previous dataset.},

  abstract = {Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and document classification. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these specific tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative fine-tuning on each specific task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during fine-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures specifically crafted for each task, significantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9\% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7\% on question answering (RACE), and 1.5\% on textual entailment (MultiNLI).},

We provide multiple flavors to cover a wide range of applications: foundation models (Code Llama), Python specializations (Code Llama - Python), and instruction-following models (Code Llama - Instruct) with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters each. All models are trained on sequences of 16k tokens and show improvements on inputs with up to 100k tokens. 7B and 13B Code Llama and Code Llama - Instruct variants support infilling based on surrounding content. Code Llama reaches state-of-the-art performance among open models on several code benchmarks, with scores of up to 53\% and 55\% on HumanEval and MBPP, respectively. Notably, Code Llama - Python 7B outperforms Llama 2 70B on HumanEval and MBPP, and all our models outperform every other publicly available model on MultiPL-E. We release Code Llama under a permissive license that allows for both research and commercial use.},

Our solutions are based on the BERT Transformer models, the constrained versions of our models reaching 1st place in two subtasks and 3rd place in one subtask, while our unconstrained models outperform all the constrained systems by a large margin. We show in our analyses that Transformer-based models outperform traditional models by far, and that improvements obtained by pre-training models on large quantities of (mostly standard) text are significant, but not drastic, with single-language models also outperforming multilingual models. Our manual analysis shows that two types of signals are the most crucial for a (mis)prediction: named entities and dialectal features, both of which are handled well by our models.},

To obtain the requisite knowledge of users' motivations in adopting ChatGPT, we conducted a survey among ChatGPT users (N = 197) and analyzed the findings within the uses and gratifications (U\&G) theoretical framework. We identified six primary motivations for using ChatGPT: productivity, novelty, creative work, learning and development, entertainment, and social interaction and support. Our findings demonstrate that a general-purpose conversational AI such as ChatGPT have the potential to impact multiple aspects of human life, from enhancing work efficiency to shaping communication between individuals. We consider the possible consequences of such diverse user motivations and highlight potential avenues for further research.},

This paper considers the ethics of the decision to send artificially intelligent robots into war, by asking who we should hold responsible when an autonomous weapon system is involved in an atrocity of the sort that would normally be described as a war crime. A number of possible loci of responsibility for robot war crimes are canvassed: the persons who designed or programmed the system, the commanding officer who ordered its use, the machine itself. I argue that in fact none of these are ultimately satisfactory. Yet it is a necessary condition for fighting a just war, under the principle of jus in bellum, that someone can be justly held responsible for deaths that occur in the course of the war. As this condition cannot be met in relation to deaths caused by an autonomous weapon system it would therefore be unethical to deploy such systems in warfare.},

  abstract = {Generating diverse, interesting responses to chitchat conversations is a problem for neural conversational agents. This paper makes two substantial contributions to improving diversity in dialogue generation. First, we propose a novel metric which uses Natural Language Inference (NLI) to measure the semantic diversity of a set of model responses for a conversation. We evaluate this metric using an established framework (Tevet and Berant, 2021) and find strong evidence indicating NLI Diversity is correlated with semantic diversity. Specifically, we show that the contradiction relation is more useful than the neutral relation for measuring this diversity and that incorporating the NLI model's confidence achieves state-of-the-art results. Second, we demonstrate how to iteratively improve the semantic diversity of a sampled set of responses via a new generation procedure called Diversity Threshold Generation, which results in an average 137\% increase in NLI Diversity compared to standard generation procedures.},

  abstract = {During the last stage of RLHF, a large language model is aligned to human intents via PPO training, a process that generally requires large-scale computational resources. In this technical report, we empirically investigate an efficient implementation of RLHF using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which allows us to align the LLaMA 7B checkpoint on the Alpaca dataset using only two A100 GPUs instead of the eight required for full model fine-tuning. Despite tuning only 0.2\% of LLaMA 7B's parameters, our implementation achieves better performance than the publicly-released AlpacaFarm checkpoint with full model fine-tuning. Next, we analyze several configurations of our LoRA-based PPO implementation, varying the form of the KL regularization term in the training objective. We find that (1) removing this penalty term does not harm performance on the AlpacaFarm evaluation set under our LoRA setup; (2) other regularizers, such as Jensen-Shannon divergence, lead to improved performance; and (3) while PPO training negatively impacts the factuality of model-generated responses, training with LoRA largely mitigates this effect. We release our code and pretrained checkpoints to facilitate future research on more efficient RLHF.},

Language models have already made good progress on this benchmark, with the best model in the BIG-Bench paper outperforming average reported human-rater results on 65\% of the BIG-Bench tasks via few-shot prompting. But on what tasks do language models fall short of average human-rater performance, and are those tasks actually unsolvable by current language models? In this work, we focus on a suite of 23 challenging BIG-Bench tasks which we call BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). These are the task for which prior language model evaluations did not outperform the average human-rater. We find that applying chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to BBH tasks enables PaLM to surpass the average human-rater performance on 10 of the 23 tasks, and Codex (code-davinci-002) to surpass the average human-rater performance on 17 of the 23 tasks. Since many tasks in BBH require multi-step reasoning, few-shot prompting without CoT, as done in the BIG-Bench evaluations (Srivastava et al., 2022), substantially underestimates the best performance and capabilities of language models, which is better captured via CoT prompting. As further analysis, we explore the interaction between CoT and model scale on BBH, finding that CoT enables emergent task performance on several BBH tasks with otherwise flat scaling curves.},

  abstract = {The swift advancement and widespread availability of foundational Large Language Models (LLMs), complemented by robust fine-tuning methodologies, have catalyzed their adaptation for innovative and industrious applications. Enabling LLMs to recognize and interpret geospatial data, while offering a linguistic access to vast cartographic datasets, is of significant importance. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the most ambitious open-source global initiative offering detailed urban and rural geographic data, curated by a community of over 10 million contributors, which constitutes a great potential for LLM applications. In this study, we demonstrate the proof of concept and details of the process of fine-tuning a relatively small scale (1B parameters) LLM with a relatively small artificial dataset curated by a more capable teacher model, in order to provide a linguistic interface to the OSM data of an arbitrary urban region. Through this interface, users can inquire about a location's attributes, covering a wide spectrum of concepts, such as its touristic appeal or the potential profitability of various businesses in that vicinity. The study aims to provide an initial guideline for such generative artificial intelligence (AI) adaptations and demonstrate early signs of useful emerging abilities in this context even in minimal computational settings. The embeddings of artificially curated prompts including OSM data are also investigated in detail, which might be instrumental for potential geospatially aware urban Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.},

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {Large "instruction-tuned" language models (i.e., finetuned to respond to instructions) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to generalize zero-shot to new tasks. Nevertheless, they depend heavily on human-written instruction data that is often limited in quantity, diversity, and creativity, therefore hindering the generality of the tuned model. We introduce Self-Instruct, a framework for improving the instruction-following capabilities of pretrained language models by bootstrapping off their own generations. Our pipeline generates instructions, input, and output samples from a language model, then filters invalid or similar ones before using them to finetune the original model. Applying our method to the vanilla GPT3, we demonstrate a 33\% absolute improvement over the original model on Super-NaturalInstructions, on par with the performance of InstructGPT-001, which was trained with private user data and human annotations. For further evaluation, we curate a set of expert-written instructions for novel tasks, and show through human evaluation that tuning GPT3 with Self-Instruct outperforms using existing public instruction datasets by a large margin, leaving only a 5\% absolute gap behind InstructGPT-001. Self-Instruct provides an almost annotation-free method for aligning pre-trained language models with instructions, and we release our large synthetic dataset to facilitate future studies on instruction tuning.

This paper describes a catalog of prompt engineering techniques presented in pattern form that have been applied to solve common problems when conversing with LLMs. Prompt patterns are a knowledge transfer method analogous to software patterns since they provide reusable solutions to common problems faced in a particular context, i.e., output generation and interaction when working with LLMs. This paper provides the following contributions to research on prompt engineering that apply LLMs to automate software development tasks. First, it provides a framework for documenting patterns for structuring prompts to solve a range of problems so that they can be adapted to different domains. Second, it presents a catalog of patterns that have been applied successfully to improve the outputs of LLM conversations. Third, it explains how prompts can be built from multiple patterns and illustrates prompt patterns that benefit from combination with other prompt patterns.},

The conventional geospatial standards work great with online platforms such as CesiumJS or ArcGIS API for JavaScript. However, their usage in different platforms such as game engines has not been well established yet. Game engines provide an interesting application case because they offer a different approach to visualizing large city models and provide a high graphical fidelity. This paper aims to answer how the existing standards, such as the API standards GeoVolumes and SensorThings, as well as the 3D model standards 3D Tiles and Esri Indexed 3D Scene Layer (I3S), can interact with game engines. For this purpose, three use-cases were selected and have been used to build applications. These focus on using sensor data in AR and different city development scenarios in a digital environment. This study shows that different geospatial standard formats such as 3D Tiles, I3S, and GL Transmission Format (glTF) can be used in game engines, either directly or over a GeoVolumes Server. Their implementation makes it possible to use the advantages of game engines with real-world datasets.},

  abstract = {Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is essential for safe and useful LLMs. Previous works mainly adopt reinforcement learning (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) with human feedback for alignment. Nevertheless, they have certain drawbacks. One such limitation is that they can only align models with one preference at the training time (e.g., they cannot learn to generate concise responses when the preference data prefers detailed responses), or have certain constraints for the data format (e.g., DPO only supports pairwise preference data). To this end, prior works incorporate controllable generations for alignment to make language models learn multiple preferences and provide outputs with different preferences during inference if asked. Controllable generation also offers more flexibility with regard to data format (e.g., it supports pointwise preference data). Specifically, it uses different control tokens for different preferences during training and inference, making LLMs behave differently when required. Current controllable generation methods either use a special token or hand-crafted prompts as control tokens, and optimize them together with LLMs. As control tokens are typically much lighter than LLMs, this optimization strategy may not effectively optimize control tokens. To this end, we first use parameter-efficient tuning (e.g., prompting tuning and low-rank adaptation) to optimize control tokens and then fine-tune models for controllable generations, similar to prior works. Our approach, alignMEnt with parameter-Efficient Tuning (MEET), improves the quality of control tokens, thus improving controllable generation quality consistently by an apparent margin on two well-recognized datasets compared with prior works.},

The natural questions are: i) Retrieval-augmentation versus long context window, which one is better for downstream tasks? ii) Can both methods be combined to get the best of both worlds? In this work, we answer these questions by studying both solutions using two state-of-the-art pretrained LLMs, i.e., a proprietary 43B GPT and LLaMA2-70B. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that LLM with 4K context window using simple retrieval-augmentation at generation can achieve comparable performance to finetuned LLM with 16K context window via positional interpolation on long context tasks, while taking much less computation. More importantly, we demonstrate that retrieval can significantly improve the performance of LLMs regardless of their extended context window sizes. Our best model, retrieval-augmented LLaMA2-70B with 32K context window, outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo-16k and Davinci003 in terms of average score on seven long context tasks including question answering and query-based summarization. It also outperforms its non-retrieval LLaMA2-70B-32k baseline by a margin, while being much faster at generation. Our study provides general insights on the choice of retrieval-augmentation versus long context extension of LLM for practitioners.},

In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34\% and 10\% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.

This means they can fall short in tasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play a pivotal role. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for language model inference, Tree of Thoughts (ToT), which generalizes over the popular Chain of Thought approach to prompting language models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text (thoughts) that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving. ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices. Our experiments show that ToT significantly enhances language models' problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords. For instance, in Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only solved 4\% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74\%.

Our work serves as a first step in determining which particular representations and competences, as well as which kinds of knowledge or skills, can be derived from particular learning techniques and data. In particular, we explore which kinds of cognitive capacities can be enabled by statistical analysis of large-scale linguistic data.

  abstract = {Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) hold promise to produce language understanding systems that are are factual, efficient, and up-to-date. An important desideratum of RALMs, is that retrieved information helps model performance when it is relevant, and does not harm performance when it is not. This is particularly important in multi-hop reasoning scenarios, where misuse of irrelevant evidence can lead to cascading errors. However, recent work has shown that retrieval augmentation can sometimes have a negative effect on performance. In this work, we present a thorough analysis on five open-domain question answering benchmarks, characterizing cases when retrieval reduces accuracy. We then propose two methods to mitigate this issue. First, a simple baseline that filters out retrieved passages that do not entail question-answer pairs according to a natural language inference (NLI) model. This is effective in preventing performance reduction, but at a cost of also discarding relevant passages. Thus, we propose a method for automatically generating data to fine-tune the language model to properly leverage retrieved passages, using a mix of relevant and irrelevant contexts at training time. We empirically show that even 1,000 examples suffice to train the model to be robust to irrelevant contexts while maintaining high performance on examples with relevant ones.},

  abstract = {Recent work by Zellers et al. (2018) introduced a new task of commonsense natural language inference: given an event description such as "A woman sits at a piano," a machine must select the most likely followup: "She sets her fingers on the keys." With the introduction of BERT, near human-level performance was reached. Does this mean that machines can perform human level commonsense inference? In this paper, we show that commonsense inference still proves difficult for even state-of-the-art models, by presenting HellaSwag, a new challenge dataset. Though its questions are trivial for humans ({$>$}95\% accuracy), state-of-the-art models struggle ({$<$}48\%). We achieve this via Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data collection paradigm wherein a series of discriminators iteratively select an adversarial set of machine-generated wrong answers. AF proves to be surprisingly robust. The key insight is to scale up the length and complexity of the dataset examples towards a critical 'Goldilocks' zone wherein generated text is ridiculous to humans, yet often misclassified by state-of-the-art models. Our construction of HellaSwag, and its resulting difficulty, sheds light on the inner workings of deep pretrained models. More broadly, it suggests a new path forward for NLP research, in which benchmarks co-evolve with the evolving state-of-the-art in an adversarial way, so as to present ever-harder challenges.},

  abstract = {Decision-makers in GIS need to combine a series of spatial algorithms and operations to solve geospatial tasks. For example, in the task of facility siting, the Buffer tool is usually first used to locate areas close or away from some specific entities; then, the Intersect or Erase tool is used to select candidate areas satisfied multiple requirements. Though professionals can easily understand and solve these geospatial tasks by sequentially utilizing relevant tools, it is difficult for non-professionals to handle these problems. Recently, Generative Pre-trained Transformer (e.g., ChatGPT) presents strong performance in semantic understanding and reasoning. Especially, AutoGPT can further extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by automatically reasoning and calling externally defined tools. Inspired by these studies, we attempt to lower the threshold of non-professional users to solve geospatial tasks by integrating the semantic understanding ability inherent in LLMs with mature tools within the GIS community. Specifically, we develop a new framework called GeoGPT that can conduct geospatial data collection, processing, and analysis in an autonomous manner with the instruction of only natural language. In other words, GeoGPT is used to understand the demands of non-professional users merely based on input natural language descriptions, and then think, plan, and execute defined GIS tools to output final effective results. Several cases including geospatial data crawling, spatial query, facility siting, and mapping validate the effectiveness of our framework. Though limited cases are presented in this paper, GeoGPT can be further extended to various tasks by equipping with more GIS tools, and we think the paradigm of "foundational plus professional" implied in GeoGPT provides an effective way to develop next-generation GIS in this era of large foundation models.},

  abstract = {Efficient information search from building information models (BIMs) requires deep BIM knowledge or extensive engineering efforts for building natural language (NL)-based interfaces. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a dynamic prompt-based virtual assistant framework dubbed ``BIMS-GPT'' that integrates generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) technologies, supporting NL-based BIM search. To understand users' NL queries, extract relevant information from BIM databases, and deliver NL responses along with 3D visualizations, a dynamic prompt-based process was developed. In a case study, BIMS-GPT's functionality is demonstrated through a virtual assistant prototype for a hospital building. When evaluated with a BIM query dataset, the approach achieves accuracy rates of 99.5\% for classifying NL queries with incorporating 2\% of the data in prompts. This paper contributes to the advancement of effective and versatile virtual assistants for BIMs in the construction industry as it significantly enhances BIM accessibility while reducing the engineering and training data prerequisites for processing NL queries.},

  abstract = {While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a range of decision-making tasks, they rely on simple acting processes and fall short of broad deployment as autonomous agents. We introduce LATS (Language Agent Tree Search), a general framework that synergizes the capabilities of LLMs in planning, acting, and reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Monte Carlo tree search in model-based reinforcement learning, LATS employs LLMs as agents, value functions, and optimizers, repurposing their latent strengths for enhanced decision-making. What is crucial in this method is the use of an environment for external feedback, which offers a more deliberate and adaptive problem-solving mechanism that moves beyond the limitations of existing techniques. Our experimental evaluation across diverse domains, such as programming, HotPotQA, and WebShop, illustrates the applicability of LATS for both reasoning and acting. In particular, LATS achieves 94.4{\textbackslash}\% for programming on HumanEval with GPT-4 and an average score of 75.9 for web browsing on WebShop with GPT-3.5, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of our method.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the unprecedented growth of online social media, resulting in short texts being the prevalent format of information on the Internet. Given the sparsity of data, however, short-text topic modeling remains a critical yet much-watched challenge in both academia and industry. Research has been devoted to building different types of probabilistic topic models for short texts, among which self-aggregation methods emerged recently to provide informative cross-text word co-occurrences. However, models along this line are still in their infancy and typically yield overfit results and exhibit high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Pseudo-document-based Topic Model (PTM), which introduces the concept of pseudo-document to implicitly aggregate short texts against data sparsity. By modeling the topic distributions of latent pseudo-documents rather than short texts, PTM yields excellent performance in accuracy and efficiency. A word embedding-enhanced PTM (WE-PTM) is also proposed to leverage pre-trained word embeddings, which is essential to further alleviating data sparsity. Extensive experiments with self-aggregation or word embedding-based baselines on four real-world datasets including two online media short texts, demonstrate the high-quality topics learned by our models. Robustness to limited training samples and the explainable semantics of topics are also investigated.},
