- Extract all roads with a speed limit greater than or equal to 80 km/h.

ChatGPT:

- Error analyzing

It appears that there was an error because the column name 'speed' does not exist in the "Fartsgrense.geojson" file. To proceed, I'll first examine the column names in the file to identify the correct column name for speed limits. Let's take a look at the column names. ​​

The column names in the "Fartsgrense.geojson" file do not include a 'speed' column, but there is a column named 'fartsgrenseVerdi' which likely represents the speed limit. I will use this column to filter the data for roads with a speed limit greater than or equal to 80 km/h. Let's extract that information now. ​​

The extracted data from the "Fartsgrense.geojson" file includes roads with a speed limit greater than or equal to 80 km/h. The key details for these high-speed roads include:

- **gml_id** : Unique identifier for each road segment.
- **lokalId** : Local identification number.
- **navnerom** : Namespace identifier.
- **versjonId** : Version number.
- **oppdateringsdato** : Date of the last update.
- **fartsgrenseVerdi** : Speed limit value, which is 80 km/h or higher for these roads.
- **gyldigFraDato** : Date from which the speed limit is valid.
- **lineærReferanseMetode** : Method of linear referencing.
- **retning** : Direction of the road segment.
- **lineærPosisjon...lokalId** : Local identification for linear position.
- **lineærPosisjon...navnerom** : Namespace for linear position.
- **fraPosisjon** : Starting position of the road segment.
- **tilPosisjon** : Ending position of the road segment.
- **felt** : Lane information (if available).
- **vedtaksnummer** : Decision number (if available).
- **arkivnummer** : Archive number (if available).
- **geometry** : Geometric representation of the road segment.

This summary provides an overview of the high-speed roads included in the file, with speed limits of 80 km/h or more. ​​

ChatGPT:

- The centroids of the building locations in the "MatrikkelBygning.geojson" file have been calculated. These centroids represent the geometric center of each building's location. Here are the coordinates of the first few centroids:

1. Point (275499.650, 7038741.208)
2. Point (275542.361, 7038247.964)
3. Point (275555.077, 7038291.751)
4. Point (275553.257, 7038281.360)
5. Point (275551.451, 7038272.937)

- To select all buildings located within 50 meters of a high-speed road (with a speed limit of 80 km/h or more), I'll perform a spatial join between the buildings data and the high-speed roads data. This will identify buildings that are within 50 meters of any segment of these roads. Let's proceed with this analysis.

- Find the area best suited for expansion to accommodate residential buildings.

ChatGPT:

- To identify the area best suited for expansion to accommodate residential buildings using the data from the "MatrikkelBygning.geojson" and "Fartsgrense.geojson" files, we should consider several factors:

1. **Proximity to High-Speed Roads** : Areas should not be too close to high-speed roads for safety and noise considerations.
2. **Current Building Density** : Less densely populated areas or those with fewer existing buildings might be more suitable for expansion.
3. **Geographic Features and Constraints** : Natural features like water bodies, hills, and protected areas should be considered.
4. **Spatial Distribution** : An area evenly distributed between the current buildings might be preferable for balanced development.

Given these considerations, the analysis will involve:

- Identifying less densely populated areas.
- Ensuring these areas are a safe distance from high-speed roads.
- Considering the geographic distribution of the land.

Let's proceed with this analysis.

Error analyzing

It appears that there was an error in the code due to the use of an undefined function `box`. To correct this, I will import the necessary function from `shapely.geometry` and then proceed with the analysis to find suitable areas for residential expansion. Let's retry this step. ​![Output image](img/5.png)

I have plotted the areas that are potentially suitable for residential expansion. These areas are depicted in blue, avoiding proximity to high-speed roads (in red) and considering the existing buildings (in green). You can view and download the map image from the following link:
